# Pre-commit hooks run at `git commit` time, catching lint/format issues before
# they reach CI. This is especially valuable for agent-dispatched work — agents
# can self-correct without coordinator intervention.
#
# Keep hooks fast (lint + format only). Heavy checks (mypy, full test suite) stay in CI.
