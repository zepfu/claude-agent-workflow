# TASKS.md — Task Injection File

> **For the human operator.** Add tasks below while the orchestrator is running. The project coordinator checks this file before every routing cycle and incorporates new tasks into the active plan.
>
> Format: `- [ ]` for new tasks, `- [x]` once dispatched. Include priority and optionally suggest an agent.

## Injected Tasks

<!-- Add new tasks here. Examples:
- [ ] **PRIORITY:HIGH** Fix: [service] crashes on [condition]. Assign to [AGENT].
- [ ] **PRIORITY:MEDIUM** Add: [feature] to [component]. Assign to [AGENT].
- [ ] **PRIORITY:LOW** Chore: Add [tool] to CI pipeline.
- [ ] **PRIORITY:CRITICAL** Halt [feature] work. Redirect all agents to [priority] immediately.
- [ ] Investigate: intermittent [error] on [endpoint]. Assign to [AGENT] + [AGENT].

## Questions for Operator

<!-- The project coordinator writes questions here when injected tasks are ambiguous or conflict with the current plan. -->
