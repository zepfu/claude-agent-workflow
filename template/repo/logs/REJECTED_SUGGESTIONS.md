# REJECTED_SUGGESTIONS.md — Rejected Suggestion Archive

> **Append-only log of rejected suggestions.** Before writing a new suggestion to CLAUDE_SUGGESTIONS.md, check this file to avoid re-proposing previously rejected items.
>
> If circumstances have changed significantly and a previously rejected suggestion is now warranted, note the changed circumstances when re-proposing — the operator can see it was rejected before and understand why it's being raised again.
